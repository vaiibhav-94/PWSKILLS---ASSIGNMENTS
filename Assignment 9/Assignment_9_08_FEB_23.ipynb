The abstraction of the bank account object could be represented by its properties such as account number and balance, and methods such as deposit and withdraw.

    "The encapsulation of the bank account object could be achieved by declaring the properties such as account number and balance as private, and providing the methods such as deposit and withdraw as public. This encapsulation ensures that the user can only access the account information through the provided methods and cannot directly access or modify the account number or balance properties.\n",
